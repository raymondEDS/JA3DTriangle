# iFIND

This project seeks to develop a tool to help with the Filming Interactions to Nurture Development (FIND) project. By using multimodal modeling we are developing a human-in-the-loop software that aims to identify the serve and return process within developmental psychology.

We had the privilege of presenting our preliminary research findings at [Early Learning and Development: Advancing Science for Positive Impact
IHD Flash Talks](https://ihd.berkeley.edu/events/seminar-series/early-learning-and-development-advancing-science-for-positive-impact).
